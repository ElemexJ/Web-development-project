# H1 Developer: 
## H2 Review social network documentation and refine/amend the social network/app Project Definition and Requirements.

Probably too complicated - way too many functions that talk to other people (instant messaging, coding site, playing the uploaded games) so will switch to something a bit different

Probably will do something like an arcade site -> Advice on different games, arcades around based on proximityâ€¦? (might be hard to send stuff to the sites and then have that be sent back to the site again based on a location).

## H2 Requirements definitions should include Functional (what the app will do) and Non-functional (what the app will look like and how will it perform). 

| Functional | Non-Functional |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tells the user tips and tricks for levels/arcade games | Should have an minimalistic but decently flashy look to it |
| Blogging thing? Maybe something like Quora where you ask questions and you can respond. | Performs smoothly and graphically pleasing |
| Ability to browse and navigate the site to different arcade games | Nice loading screens, smooth transitions and no visually confusing bugs or texts |
| Can update on arcade credit sales in the area? |  |

Please consider the scope of the project and what is able to be offered within the timeframe - Mr Clark will be talk you through this aspect of the project.

- Make sure that priorities are in check -> the actual purpose of the site is to inform the user on tips and tricks to beat/achive good scores on arcade games.
- Need multiple different pages with unique purposes.
