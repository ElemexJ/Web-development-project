# Web-development-project
Assesment 3 10CPT FSHS

# Developer: 
(Review social network documentation and refine/amend the social network/app Project Definition and Requirements.)

Probably too complicated - way too many functions that talk to other people (instant messaging, coding site, playing the uploaded games) so will switch to something a bit different

Probably will do something like an arcade site -> Advice on different games, arcades around based on proximityâ€¦? (might be hard to send stuff to the sites and then have that be sent back to the site again based on a location).

## Requirements definitions should include Functional (what the app will do) and Non-functional (what the app will look like and how will it perform). 

| Functional | Non-Functional |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Tells the user tips and tricks for levels/arcade games | Should have an minimalistic but decently flashy look to it - neon colours and such, while still being easy to read (non unlike the timezone website)|
| Blogging thing? Maybe something like Quora where you ask questions and you can respond. | Performs smoothly and graphically pleasing |
| Ability to browse and navigate the site to different arcade games - ddr levels, Bishibashi levels, hammer game scores, ect | Nice loading screens, smooth transitions and no visually confusing bugs or texts |
| Can update on arcade credit sales in the area?(optional but nice to have) |  |

## Please consider the scope of the project and what is able to be offered within the timeframe - Mr Clark will be talk you through this aspect of the project.

- Make sure that priorities are in check -> the actual purpose of the site is to inform the user on tips and tricks to beat/achive good scores on arcade games.
- Need multiple different pages with unique purposes.

# Client: 
(Developer presents their understanding of the project and talk through whether the project is achievable and issues with the scope.)

## Notes as the developer on client feedback
- UI and UX are good and should be implemented well
- Coding and implementing needs time to be implemented -> needs to save lots of time for that
- No negative feeback, just need more reseaching about proximity based information
- Everything is clear and answered to a satisfactory level

### ACTION ITEMS
- Decide the colour sceme -> neon/bright or pop colours (Due by 1/08)
- Research ab/ goals of the site (code, incoperating difficult/complicated aspects of the site) -> look at similar sites for inspiration (1/08)

## Retrospecitve Client meeting (As the Client)
Waiting on the developer.
